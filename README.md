# Smartwatch-Fitness-Data-Analysis-using-Python
## Objective: Analyze smartwatch fitness data to uncover insights into users' daily activity patterns, calorie expenditure, and activity levels.  
## Dataset:Publicly available Fitbit dataset from Kaggle, consisting of data from 30 female users.  
## Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly.  
## Key Tasks:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., handling date formats).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify activity trends.  
- Visualization of activity patterns (e.g., active minutes, calories burned).  
- Analysis of daily and weekly activity behavior.  
## Insights Gained:  
- Linear relationship between total steps and calories burned.  
- Distribution of active vs. sedentary minutes throughout the week.  
- Identification of the most active and inactive days.
- Outcome: Provided actionable insights into fitness habits and activity trends using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.
